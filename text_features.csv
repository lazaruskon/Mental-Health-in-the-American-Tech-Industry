"Last year I was dealing with an active episode of depression.  Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.","Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude",,A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it,,,,tech is club where any sort of weakness is unacceptable.,,,

I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).

The conversation's purpose was definitely to vent - she and I both shared similar feelings, and were able to confide in one another in a meaningful way. ",See answer to letter O.,,,,"If it directly impacted my job, I would be more willing to divulge such information. But I would be wary of perceived or actual judgment and/or discrimination at the hands of my employer. This discrimination could be very implicit, e.g. - exclusion from important conversations pertinent to my job, exclusion from outside colleague gatherings (happy hours, lunches, etc.). ","Mental health concerns still seem more stigmatized than physical health concerns, particularly  in a very ""chicken or egg"" way - what I mean by that is, is mental health still stigmatized in the workplace because employees don't vocalize their issues or concerns, or is it stigmatized because employees DO bring up these concerns and employers don't actively provide solutions to help solve the problem? I suspect the latter. ","My colleague was experiencing work burnout due to a number of factors (we had very high expectations when it came to work output, and the job demanded a fair amount of travel). When she expressed this feeling of burnout, her options to mitigate the problem were pretty limited - take on less work (and get paid less, since we were contractors), or forfeit her contract, neither of which were viable options considering she was the sole breadwinner between her and her husband. She ended up grinning and bearing with it at a comparably intense level, then became pregnant and eventually quit the job. I suspect that had she received proper support, she would have stayed with the company even during her pregnancy. ","I think the first step is acknowledging mental health as a priority in the tech community. In this industry, there's huge emphasis placed on output of information, data, and tangible results - often at the expense of the employees actually producing these results. Recognition and acknowledgment on a real, fundamental level would do a lot to change companies' stances on mental health. ",

All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person.
